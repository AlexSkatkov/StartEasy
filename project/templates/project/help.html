    <p>Application-the essence of the system focus on the mandatory components/</p>
    <p>General_Architecture-Highlights This special component may be used in the initiation phase to indicate principles, requirements, general perception, etc</p>
    <p>Current situation-Specify the ratio between the planned system and the current state: A completely new system, without any connection to an existing system (manual or computerized) New system, but weak connection to existing system (manual or automated) Expansion of an existing system (new edition) - A brief description of the existing system A new system but similar to another system: in the organization, in other organizations,</p>
    <p>System character and type-Is the system required in its general nature: Batch system Online system (online transactions) centralized, decentralized, server / client Other </p>
    <p>Constraints - Various constraints that the system will have to comply with, in particular: constraints of law and administration, such as: law requirements (Local, international conventions), organizational rules / regulations, ethics and professional norms, etc.</p>
    <p>Glossary- Special terms for this system</p>
    <p>External demarcation- Who uses the system other the the client</p>
    <p>Internal demarcation -Give a general description of the system (in text, chart, etc., as you see fit)</p>
    <p>User Interface- This component should specify general and preliminary requirements of the type of user interface required, taking into consideration The vitality of the organization's system on the one hand, and the skills of potential users and their experience in computerized systems On the other hand. Specify the required human engineering level: Low, Medium, High.</p>
    <p>Processes -It is worthwhile to document this component only if the information is available and clear and there is a natural and direct continuity from the previous components.</p>
    <p>Code tables- A list of tables (symbols, codes) that are already at this point an integral part of the system Concise and short of central symbols by name alone. Next to each name, specify: If the icon is known and agreed: try to give a reference to an exact setting. If the symbol is not defined and agreed: Specify "to handle the characterization phase". The recommendation to try to mention tables already in the initiation stage stems from a great deal of experience that proves that certain symbols in the organization They are a foundation and constitute the "heart of the system" and it is relatively easy to locate them already in initiation. This is especially true In cases of adding a new edition or rewriting / revising an existing system</p>
    <p>Logical files -Estimated central data files. See explanation in previous component.</p>
    <p>Dictionary of information - Reference of estimated primary information items (other than symbols)</p>
    <p>Reports- Try to specify several main reports (3-5) that the system will need to produce.</p>
    <p>Data Security -Specify the required security level: Low, Medium, High.</p>
    <p>Volumes, loads and performance- Try to estimate the estimated perimeter of the system in terms of: Number of expected work stations Requirements for response times (by shifts / user types): normal, fast (short), extremely fast. Special load periods Storage space, expected growth rate If it is difficult to give numbers, specify barriers - upper and lower.</p>
    <p>Interfaces and links- Connect to other applications - in or out of the organization. Are there any similar or similar systems you are likely to have? Connections of the type: Data transfer and information relations: input sources, reporting requirements, etc. Messaging and requests for services Sharing information: contacting common databases, comparing databases, etc. Sharing components: code snippets, libraries, tables, routines, information items, etc.</p>
    <p>Technology and infrastructure -The technology component is not required at the initiation stage</p>
    <p>General Architecture- This special component may be used At the initiation stage, principles are noted, general perception, concentration / decentralization options, etc., which are difficult to pinpoint precisely in the tree System at this time. But be careful! If this component extends beyond one page, you should carefully check if it is not preferable Disassemble the information accumulated here and assign it to the appropriate components below.</p>
    <p>Central hardware- Type of technology existing or estimated: Single PC, distributed application, central computer, Web, Additional equipment around the main technology: terminal equipment (terminals, printers), special equipment ,Extensions to the above (if already in the organization).</p>
    <p>Environmental infrastructure- Does it appear that the system will have special infrastructure requirements or that the usual office environment provides? What is the status of the infrastructure in the organization: Are there cables (power points, etc.)? To this infrastructure? In the center? On sites?</p>
    <p>Database- Are classic file organization methods sufficient? Is there a full database requirement? Is there an intention to use a data dictionary in this system?</p>
    <p>Development and maintenance tools -Specify in particular tools where it is recommended to perform the following step: characterization, prototype construction</p>
    <p>Shelf software -Does this type of system appear to be based on ready-made software packages?</p>
    <p>Hardware - Hardware, off-the-shelf software Applied shelf software, software packages End-User Tools (Office-MS) Will interfaces between these tools and the central system be required?</p>
    <p>Local private communications- Number of stations in a local connection, including, if possible, a location and schedule in "large". Number of stations in a remote connection, including, if possible, a location and schedule at "large". Is there a requirement to connect the system to a public communications network, Internet?</p>
    <p>similar Technologies- What is already known about neighboring systems, in terms of technology? To what extent technology should be considered This?</p>
    <p>Factors involved- During the initiation process, the project monitoring team must be established. Without this team - no project! As for the team The professional, if already determined - specify here. If not yet specified, refer to adjacent elements 2.4 and 3.4 as activity Perform as soon as possible. Specify a requirement for involvement of special factors such as: information security, legal authority, experts Professional and so on. Distinguish between those who are already aware of the project (and have given their consent) and those who have not yet known.</p>
    <p>Work Plan- In what method is it proposed to build the system: internally? With the help of an outside party? Home Software or hardware? With a ready software package? and so'. In light of the estimated scope of the system and other data</p>
    <p>next step- What is the next step and how is it proposed to organize it? Is he another Mafun? Is external assistance expected? If the previous section (2.4) requires a very general reference that it is difficult to draw a work plan Accurate to the overall development of the system, should at least know what is the "next step" and clearly defined, Including a proposed work plan, and resources. Use the appropriate chapter in the "System Characterization" procedure Management techniques in volume support topics.</p>
    <p>Ongoing operation- Who will perform the ongoing operation of the system and will take responsibility for it? Requirements for operating times (shifts). Resource requirements for operation (manpower, computing power, consumables). Although this component is not marked as "mandatory" at the initiation stage, it is very important to try to relate to it even if in general. There is no point in initiating a system if it is not clear how it will be activated and who will operate it.</p>
    <p>Configurations- Is it likely that this is one physical system with one configuration, or it may be a system? Which will be replicated in a variety of configurations by size, location and sites (decentralization), user communities, organizational structure, etc. Is this a decentralized system?</p>
